# SFG Spring REST Docs Example

> [Spring REST Docs](https://spring.io/projects/spring-restdocs) helps you to document RESTful services.
> It combines hand-written documentation written with [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/) and auto-generated snippets produced with [Spring MVC Test](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/#spring-mvc-test-framework). This approach frees you from the limitations of the documentation produced by tools like [Swagger](https://swagger.io/).
> It helps you to produce documentation that is accurate, concise, and well-structured. This documentation then allows your users to get the information they need with a minimum of fuss.
